# DST-Project

This project aims to develop a student teammate recommendation system by utilizing linked lists for storing student
information and trees for hierarchical organization. The linked list will store student details such as location,
department, and GPA, while the tree structure will categorize students based on these attributes. By efficiently
organizing and processing this data, the system will assist students in finding their best team mates, thus fostering
effective collaboration.
